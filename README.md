Short Summary:

Technologies Used:
Python 🐍, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib, Streamlit, pyngrok

Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline (“TeleChurn Insights”) for telecom customer churn prediction. 
🚀 Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning (handling missing values, removing duplicates) using Python, pandas, and NumPy.
Visualized data with matplotlib and seaborn for actionable insights 📈. 
Engineered features and evaluated multiple classification models—including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV 🛠️. 
Streamlined preprocessing using scikit-learn and joblib. Deployed the best-performing model as an interactive Streamlit web app, providing real-time predictions based on user input.
🌐 Leveraged pyngrok for secure and accessible cloud deployment.
